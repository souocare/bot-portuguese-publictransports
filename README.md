# bot-portuguese-publictransports
A telegram bot that gives information about Public Transportation in Portugal, specially in Lisbon. 
As of right now, it only has information from the "Metro de Lisboa" and "TTSL" (boats). More going to be added. (read "Plans for the future" below).

Below, you have an example of how the Bot works:

# Why was this project created?
Because I wanted an app, or a bot that I could get all the information in just one place. As I don't have the knowledge right now to build an app, and a Bot was easier at first, I built a bot for Telegram, to use every day.

# How to run it?
Download the files, and edit the tokens, putting your own tokens. 
Then, n the terminal, go the the folder where you put your files and write:

```
python3 main.py
```
And then, the program will be running.

What I also recommend is to create an executable file. 

# Plans for the future
* Add more public tranports:
  * Rodovi√°ria de Lisboa;
  * Comboios de Portugal;
  * Carris;
  * Fertagus;
  * Others not planned yet.

* Add a more updated telegram bot module, or make my own.

* Add offline information to when it's impossible to get the information from the web (like trying to have the schedules offline).

* Add some documentation (yes, I know it's very important and I really need to focus on this).

* Clean the code.

* Figure out where to put the program run 24/7 (but that's for me, but that's the main plan).
